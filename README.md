# Overview

This project serves as a way to generate packages for the various operating
systems I use so that I can just throw one or two files onto a new machine and
have everything configured. This also serves as a way to keep said machines up
to date and synced.

If `dotfiles` are meant to be a central configuration repository, then a
toolbox is a central tooling repository.

## NOTE

This is all a massive work in progress and there is very little rhyme or reason
for a majority of the things here. Eventually, things should move towards some
uniform setting, where `.deb`, `.msi`, and `.pkg` files can be thrown onto a
ghcr.io repository, and my tooling "just works", but that is lightyears away.
